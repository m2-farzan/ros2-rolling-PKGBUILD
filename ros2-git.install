    You should add something like this to your ~/.bashrc file:

      export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42
      source /opt/ros2/rolling/setup.bash

    This quick command will do it for you:

      printf \"\\\nexport ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42\\\nsource /opt/ros2/rolling/setup.bash\\\n\" >> ~/.bashrc

    Note 1: If you use zsh, replace '.bash' in the above lines with
    '.zsh' and add the lines to ~/.zshrc .

    Note 2: This will slow down terminal startup for a few seconds on
    cold start, and a fraction of a second for terminals that open later.
    If you know a better transparent solution, you are welcome to edit
    this.
