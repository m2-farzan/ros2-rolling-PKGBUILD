# ROS 2 (Rolling) PKGBUILD

This package aims to provide an easy way to install ROS 2 on Archlinux.

## Contribution

Note that the default branch is `extended` rather than  `master`. The 
`master` branch should reflect what is uploaded in AUR, and only 
includes the files that end user needs. OTOH, the `extended` branch 
also includes test scripts and other stuff like this README file. To avoid 
more chaos, please only push your work to this branch, and I'll rebase 
them onto `master` and push them to AUR.
